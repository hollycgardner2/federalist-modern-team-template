## VADM Moore

Every year 20 to 30 percent of college-accepted high school graduates in urban districts fail to matriculate in college in the fall—a phenomenon known as “summer melt.”

## Mr. Smerchansky

Sending students text message reminders about key tasks related to college matriculation, such as completing financial aid paperwork, have been found to increase first-year enrollment. By delivering these messages at times when students can take action, each reminder prompts direct action that supports college enrollment.
